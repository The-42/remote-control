- Add --config, -c command-line option to the remote-control binary which

  in browser mode.

Release 0.3.2 (2011-02-10)

- The VoIP ringback tone (which is played to signal ringing when placing an
  outgoing call) needs to be played back by the backend, because in contrast
  to the ring tone, it is not played by the centralized UI.
- Add support for opening a (WebKit-based) local web browser as main window
  instead of an RDP viewer.

  To enable this, add the following group to the configuration file, usually
  to be found in /etc/remote-control.conf:

    [browser]
    uri = http://www.google.com/ncr

  If both [rdp] and [browser] groups are present, [browser] wins.

Release 0.3.0 (2011-02-02)
==========================
- Distribute the client remote-control library as a shared object, so that it
  can be shared between the command-line and the Gtk+ clients. Only symbols
  that are actually used are exported (if supported by the toolchain) in order
  to slim down the library slim and make it faster to load.
- Always hide the mouse cursor.
- Delay 90 to 120 seconds at startup before initiating the RDP session to work
  around crummy garbage collection algorithms in terminal servers.

- Make video playback backend selectable.
  * Add initial gstreamer video backend implementation.

- Use as few threads as possible in order to avoid multithreading issues. This
  fixes a bug where the mixer commands would not work properly in the ALSA
  implementation.
- Add an lldp-dump command to the remote-control-client.
- Fix a bug in the client VoIP login implementation that would crash the
  remote-control server.
- Fix LLDP frame transmission. Only the amount of data contained in an LLDP
  frame should be transferred, instead of the maximum number of bytes
  requested.
- Miscellaneous cleanups and removal of most debugging output messages.

Release 0.2.0 (2011-01-13)
==========================
- Fix handling of hook on/off events.
- Implement basic VoIP event handling.
- Store VoIP contact for later retrieval.
- Add support for SIP domains by allowing a domain to be encoded within the
  username (i.e. user@domain.tld).
- Add INI file type configuration file support. Currently only the [rdp] group
  is supported, which contains RDP connection information (hostname, username
  and password.
- Disable D-Bus code.
- Automatically reconnect RDP sessions.
- Make video window input-transparent so that events are passed through to the
  window below (user-interface).
- Set the media playback audio volume to maximum.
- Fix a bug where event processing would be blocked between when a client
  disconnects and when another connection is established.

Release 0.1.4 (2011-01-04)
==========================
- Miscellaneous build fixes.
- Port Gtk+ client from the former tc project.
- Enable I2C smartcard functionality.
- Make event-handling actually work (note: some functionality is still missing
  though).
- Use old and broken VoIP login function. The new, proper version has not been
  implemented on the client side (centralized UI).
- Add backlight API implementation based on the X DPMS extension. This can
  actually only enable/disable the backlight, so setting the brightness has no
  effect besides turning the backlight off (0) or on (> 0).
- Don't perform RPC handshake upon connection because it has not been
  implemented on the client side (centralized UI).
- Fix lldp_read() to return the number of LLDP bytes actually available.
- Build against linphone 3.3.99.10 or later.

Release 0.1.2 (2010-12-09)
==========================
- Fix the "make dist" and "make distcheck" targets.
