Release 0.3.0 (2011-02-02)
==========================
- Distribute the client remote-control library as a shared object, so that it
  can be shared between the command-line and the Gtk+ clients. Only symbols
  that are actually used are exported (if supported by the toolchain) in order
  to slim down the library slim and make it faster to load.
- Always hide the mouse cursor.
- Delay 90 to 120 seconds at startup before initiating the RDP session to work
  around crummy garbage collection algorithms in terminal servers.
- Implement medcom_sound_play() call (formerly known as medcom_media_run()),
  used to play VoIP ringtones.
- Fix initial interrupt processing.

Release 0.2.2 (2011-01-25)
==========================
- Make video playback backend selectable.
  * Add initial gstreamer video backend implementation.
  * Add initial null video backend implementation.
- Use as few threads as possible in order to avoid multithreading issues. This
  fixes a bug where the mixer commands would not work properly in the ALSA
  implementation.
- Add an lldp-dump command to the remote-control-client.
- Fix a bug in the client VoIP login implementation that would crash the
  remote-control server.
- Fix LLDP frame transmission. Only the amount of data contained in an LLDP
  frame should be transferred, instead of the maximum number of bytes
  requested.
- Miscellaneous cleanups and removal of most debugging output messages.

Release 0.2.0 (2011-01-13)
==========================
- Fix handling of hook on/off events.
- Implement basic VoIP event handling.
- Store VoIP contact for later retrieval.
- Add support for SIP domains by allowing a domain to be encoded within the
  username (i.e. user@domain.tld).
- Add INI file type configuration file support. Currently only the [rdp] group
  is supported, which contains RDP connection information (hostname, username
  and password.
- Disable D-Bus code.
- Automatically reconnect RDP sessions.
- Make video window input-transparent so that events are passed through to the
  window below (user-interface).
- Set the media playback audio volume to maximum.
- Fix a bug where event processing would be blocked between when a client
  disconnects and when another connection is established.

Release 0.1.4 (2011-01-04)
==========================
- Miscellaneous build fixes.
- Port Gtk+ client from the former tc project.
- Enable I2C smartcard functionality.
- Make event-handling actually work (note: some functionality is still missing
  though).
- Use old and broken VoIP login function. The new, proper version has not been
  implemented on the client side (centralized UI).
- Add backlight API implementation based on the X DPMS extension. This can
  actually only enable/disable the backlight, so setting the brightness has no
  effect besides turning the backlight off (0) or on (> 0).
- Don't perform RPC handshake upon connection because it has not been
  implemented on the client side (centralized UI).
- Fix lldp_read() to return the number of LLDP bytes actually available.
- Build against linphone 3.3.99.10 or later.

Release 0.1.2 (2010-12-09)
==========================
- Fix the "make dist" and "make distcheck" targets.
