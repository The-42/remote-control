* Allow the client remote-control shared library to be used by external
  projects. Currently, the src/client/remote-control.h header requires types
  and structures defined by the stub generated from the protocol description
  so that the library can only be used if the stub header is available, which
  is not the case for external projects. One possible way to solve this would
  be to abstract and wrap the interface exported by the client library such
  that any dependency on the generated stub is removed.

* Enhance medcom_voip_login() to allow a domain to be specified. The signature
  will be changed eventually anyway to take the parameters from a VoIP account
  structure, at which point the account structure could easily be extended by
  an extra "domain" field.
