* Add manual pages for remote-control and the JavaScript API.

* Remove linphone playback volume boost, because there is no indication that
  it makes any difference.

* remote-control-browser:
  - Refactor web-browser and pdf-viewer widgets (BrowserView interface?)
  - Add command line option to enable/disable the mouse cursor

* JavaScript API: investigate garbage collection (when is finalize called?)

* Implement tests/gkeyfilemerge as proper unit test.

* Beef up GPIO API to provide a complete GPIO controller interface (similar
  to the Linux kernel's gpiolib).
