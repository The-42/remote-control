* remote-control-gtk: Get rid of the g_client global variable.

* Enhance medcom_voip_login() to allow a domain to be specified. The signature
  will be changed eventually anyway to take the parameters from a VoIP account
  structure, at which point the account structure could easily be extended by
  an extra "domain" field.

* Add manual pages for remote-control, remote-control-client and
  remote-control-gtk. Also add documentation for the libremote-control client
  library.

* Wait for network connection before loading URL in browser.
