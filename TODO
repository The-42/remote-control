* remote-control-gtk: Get rid of the g_client global variable.

* Enhance medcom_voip_login() to allow a domain to be specified. The signature
  will be changed eventually anyway to take the parameters from a VoIP account
  structure, at which point the account structure could easily be extended by
  an extra "domain" field.

* Add manual pages for remote-control, remote-control-client and
  remote-control-gtk. Also add documentation for the libremote-control client
  library.

* Remove V4L2 tuner implementation. The tm6010 driver can now switch channels
  sufficiently fast to no longer require this dirty hack. Also it is much more
  stable and opening/closing the device file no longer hangs the device.

* Remove linphone playback volume boost, because there is no indication that
  it makes any difference.

* remote-control-browser:
  - Refactor web-browser and pdf-viewer widgets (BrowserView interface?)
  - Add command line option to enable/disable the mouse cursor

* JavaScript API:
  - investigate garbage collection (when is finalize called?)
  - refactor old JavaScript implementation:
    * add AvionicDesign.Cursor object with enable, disable, setPosition and
      click methods
    * add AvionicDesign.IR object with callback for IR key codes

* Implement tests/gkeyfilemerge as proper unit test.
